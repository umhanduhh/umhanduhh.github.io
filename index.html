        <p>Welcome!&nbsp;We're glad to have you. <br> Amateur Chefs Arcade is a passion project combining its creator's love for cooking and nutrition, and curiosity about coding and web development.<br> <br> Here you'll find recipes, games, and blogs to help you have more fun eating foods that bring you joy and energy. <br>You won't find any weight loss tips, shame, or prescriptive rules to follow. 
        <br><br> We're not registered dietitians, and believe that registered dietitians are the best people to give dietary advice and guidance to individuals. <br> We do love food and fueling our bodies, and want to share that love here. <br> If you'd like to connect with a registered dietitian, let us know, we'd love to introduce you to some great ones! <br> <br>Thanks to chatGPT and my husband for all the help building this, and thanks to you for being here!</p>
